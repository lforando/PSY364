#### One-page Project Proposal (5% of grade) - due March 12
You will submit a one-page proposal outlining which variables you will be using, your basic research
questions, and a set of articles you plan to read for your annotated bibliography. 

#### Annotated Bibliography (Parts 1 & 2: 5% of grade each) - Part 1 due March 26; Part 2 due April 16
You will read least 8 articles that you find yourself and provide short summaries of the findings in each.
Each summary will be more specific to your research question than the abstract provided in the articleâ€”but it
should be about 1 paragraph per article. These articles will form the basis for your final research paper and project. In this assignment you will deepen your literature searching, reading, and reviewing skills, while refining your research question. 

#### Introduction Draft (10% of grade) - due April 23
Expanding your annotated bibliography, you will write a draft of the introduction section of your final
research paper. Drafting and re-writing is an essential part of the writing process. More details for this assignment will be given during the course.

#### Methods Section and Descriptive Statistics Write-up (15% of grade) - due March 26
It is essential that you gain experience in not only analyzing data, but writing up those results in a results section. For this assignment you will draft the Method section of your final paper, as well as the descriptive statistics portion of your Results section. More details for this assignment will be given during the course.

#### Results Write-up (15% of grade) - due May 4
The bulk of your final analyses will be using either a dyadic model called the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM; Kenny, Kashy, & Cook, 2006), or multilevel modeling for overtime data. In this
assignment you will complete the draft of your results section by writing up your results. More details for this assignment will be given during the course.

#### Final Research Presentation (10%) - due May 11
You will produce 5-slide presentation and present your final research project to the class. The presentation
will be limited to around 5 minutes. These presentations will occur in the last week of the semester. 

#### Final Research Paper (30%) - due May 18
The final APA style research report is due at the end of the semester during finals week. You are expected
to revise all drafts previously submitted, incorporate them into the paper, and to complete the discussion section of your final paper.
